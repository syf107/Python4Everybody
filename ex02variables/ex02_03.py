# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per
# hour to compute gross pay.
# Enter Hours: 35
# Enter Rate: 2.75
# Pay: 96.25
# We won’t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal
# place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function
# to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.

hours = input("Enter hours: ")
rate = input("Enter rate: ")

payment = int(hours) * float(rate)

print("Pay: " + str(payment))
